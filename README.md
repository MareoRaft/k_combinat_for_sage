Code for Jennifer Morse.

I am working with [Jennifer Morse](http://math.virginia.edu/people/jlm6cj/) over the summer (and probably for a few years).  I am writing code with the goal of getting it added to the Sagemath project.  This code computes combinatorial things such as

  * k-boundaries
  * k-rim
  * k-shape partitions
  * skew-linked diagrams
  * k-irreducible partitions
  * k-irreducible-k-shapes
  * root ideals

etc.
