Sage has a builtin `Partition <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/partition.html>`_ object.  *This* module adds extra useful functions for partitions:

def boundary(ptn):
    r""" The boundary of a partition is the set `\{ \text{NE}(d) \mid \forall d\:\text{diagonal} \}`.  That is, for every diagonal line `y = x + b` where `b \in \mathbb{Z}`, we find the northeasternmost (NE) point on that diagonal which is also in the Ferrer's diagram (here, the Ferrer's diagram is interpreted as 1 x 1 cells in the Euclidean plane).

    The boundary will go from bottom-right to top-left in the French convention.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: boundary(Partition([1]))
        [(1,0), (1,1), (0,1)]

        sage: boundary(Partition([3, 1]))
