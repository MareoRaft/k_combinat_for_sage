Just a place for my theorems and conjectures.

Conjecture 1: If you take a k+1-core and remove any number of cells, the resulting partition will have a smaller k-boundary than the original k+1-core.

(I proved this in my head; the argument can probably be made rigorous)

Corollary: Therefore, if you have a k+1-core and remove cells and obtain a non-k+1-core, then if your goal is to only decrease the size of the k-bdy by 1, your next moves must be an effort towards making it a k+1-core again.
